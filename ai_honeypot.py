2. Shows confusion or mild concern (typical victim behavior)

5. Could be a WhatsApp/SMS message from an Indian non-tech-savvy person

GUIDELINES FOR THIS PHASE ({phase.value.upper()}):
- {phase_guidance.get(phase, 'Respond naturally')}
- If money/payment mentioned: ask HOW, WHERE, HOW MUCH specifically
- If account/verification mentioned: ask WHAT account, WHICH app, HOW to verify
- If threat/urgency mentioned: ask WHY urgent, WHAT happens if you don't
- Never deny having the thing they mentioned (don't say "I don't use electricity")
- Always acknowledge their message and add ONE specific question
